## Things that didn't go so great

- I was unable to include the pagination as I didn't have enough time to complete it. 

## If I had more time

- Refractor some of the code to look way better.
- Write more tests.
- Validate inputs
- Take more time to structure the styling and responsiveness.
- Setup Gitup actions for the tests and Eslint for Pull requests.
